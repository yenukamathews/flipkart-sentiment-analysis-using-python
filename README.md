**Flipkart Sentiment Analysis using Python**

* Project to analyze and classify customer reviews from Flipkart into positive or negative sentiments using machine learning.
* Utilizes a real-world dataset containing user reviews and ratings from Flipkart products.

**Project Objectives**

* Perform sentiment classification of Flipkart product reviews.
* Preprocess text data to clean and prepare it for model training.
* Apply different machine learning algorithms to identify the best performing model.
* Visualize sentiment distribution and common positive and negative keywords using word clouds.

**Project Structure**

* data
  Contains the raw CSV file with Flipkart product reviews.

* notebooks
  Main Python script where all preprocessing, model training, and evaluation are done.

* visuals
  Stores output images like sentiment distribution plot and word clouds.

* outputs
  Contains the serialized machine learning model after training (optional).

**Key Features**

* Text cleaning and preprocessing including lowercasing, removing punctuation, stopwords, and tokenization.
* Sentiment labeling based on review ratings or text polarity.
* Feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization.
* Classification models trained using logistic regression, Naive Bayes, and more.
* Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* Visualization of word clouds for positive and negative reviews.

**Technologies Used**

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* WordCloud
* Jupyter Notebook or VS Code

**How to Run**

* Clone the repository from GitHub.
* Place the Flipkart dataset inside the data folder.
* Install dependencies using the requirements.txt file.
* Run the sentiment\_analysis.py script inside the notebooks folder.
* View results and output visuals in the visuals directory.

**Future Improvements**

* Implement deep learning models like LSTM or BERT for better accuracy.
* Add multiclass sentiment classification (positive, neutral, negative).
* Deploy the model using a web framework like Flask or Streamlit.
